When I was visitting the Lowe Art Museum, the Floral Assemblage by artist [Paul Stankard](http://www.paulstankard.com/fjxi9qepsph8a7oc3m7e4nms3tssa4) in the [Palley Pavilion Collection](https://www.lowe.miami.edu/collections/palley-pavilion/index.html) grabbed my attention. I love the way it preserves flora inside crystal clear glass, like amber. So I decided to create a workshop letting audience to make their own Floral Assemblage.

#### ▼ Steps to complete activity
It's dangerous to let amateurs heat and mould glass with burning acetylene in high temperature, so epoxy would be used as a perfect substitute. Epoxy contains Glue A and Glue B. People could put miniatures inside Glue A and pour Glue B inside. After mixing them together, the liquid glue mixture would solidify in a short time in normal temperature, so the miniature will be in a piece of clear epoxy.

#### ▽ Supply list
* Epoxy(Glue A & Glue B) + containers
* Moulds (all shapes)
* Miniatures (all kinds)
* Aprons
* Disposable gloves
* Facial masks
* Working Tables
* Ventilating equipment (epoxy could be smelly

### Interactive Prototype
#### ▼ Concept Introduction
There are multiple techniques applied in making the glass art pieces displayed in the [Palley Pavilion Collection](https://www.lowe.miami.edu/collections/palley-pavilion/index.html), and audience are intrigued to know them while appreciating art. So the idea is to create an educational interactive storybook or game that shows those different techniques.
